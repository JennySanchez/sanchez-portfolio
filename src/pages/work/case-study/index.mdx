## Carbon for IBM.com Website

<div className="case-study">

<Row>

  <Column colMd={7} colLg={7}>

IBM.com is a place for people to learn about, try, and buy IBM products and services. Visitors to IBM.com deserve to have an efficient and delightful experience while on their journey.

Carbon for IBM.com is a design system built to provide efficiency and consistency across IBM.com using IBM Design Language (IDL) principles.

The IBM.com makers need a centralized place to find guidance and resources for designers and developers who create sites and applications on IBM.com and other IBM domains so that IBM can provide a seamless and integrated experience for IBM.com visitors.

### Process  
The Carbon for IBM.com website is built with the Carbon Gatsby Theme. Understanding the theme's ability and limitation is the first step before starting on the project after AI and user research are done. For the user research, I collaborate with UX designers to validate the adoptor's hypothesis and set the definition of what a Cupcake website is and should contain. The strategy is to develop a Cupcake website. This website contains the essential information that IBM.com makers need to know to download the design kit, codebase, and adapt the design system.

### Outcome  
- A total of 15,525 page-views and 5,476 users since launching in June 2020. 
- A 75% growth in page-views and 93% growth in users since launching in June 2020. 
- It brings a total of 54 pages published by the end of 2020.

The next step is to get adopter feedback, discover adopter needs from using the Cupcake website, ideate the Birthday Cake website's content structure, and craft a roadmap to grow the website to meet adopter needs continually.

## Variable Magazine


<Row>

  <Column colMd={7} colLg={7}>

Formerly known as All Things X, Variable is an internal culture magazine that focuses on unifying IBM's humans through the stories they tell. As an official IBM Studios offering, we ship thousands of volumes to every IBM Studio worldwide. I co-lead and transform culture and outcomes through attitudes, working styles, and initiatives within the team and business unit in 55 global IBM Studios. The goal is to promote our design-driven culture through purposeful and thought-provoking content.

IBMers need a way to engage and share stores actively within IBM and the larger world of design to have a sense of togetherness and build the IBM design culture.

### Process  
Every issue starts with an ideation phase. Designers who are interested in contributing to the up-coming issue pitch their ideas. We then come together as a team, select a theme for the issue, and start brainstorming story ideas. From there, we sign up for the stories we’re passionate about, and the role we want to play—designer, writer, editor, illustrator, etc. I could be the content writer for one story but a designer for another. As an IBMer, we always utilize Enterprise Design Thinking, to Observe, Reflect, and Make throughout the editorial process.

### Outcome  
At its core, Variable connects designers across the company, amplifies the culture of design across the organization, and for the clients who get the opportunity to flip through the magazine in one of our studios—it helps represent the new IBM. It is funded by the IBM Design core team, but maintains the voice of the designer in every way.

## Variable Magazine

<Row>

  <Column colMd={7} colLg={7}>

Victrola Design is a design and art line known for its whimsical, detailed flora and fauna illustrations. Founded by English artist Victoria Corbett in 2004, the brand incorporates a modern minimalist approach deeply rooted in Corbett’s everyday observations of the natural world. The designs often are inspired by the use of repetition and uniformity within existing patterns found in nature.

The artist needs a cohesive brand voice across the product line and marketing collateral so that her clients can tell her apart from other artists in the relative field and focus on showcasing her talent with an easily integrated presence.

### Process  
I worked closely with the client to develop a new brand strategy and design direction by first holding a discovery workshop. We looked at the potential competitors, created sketches and mock-ups, reviewed paper samples, and tested print to finalize the look and printing details. From there, we created a branding guide to serve as a reference. The transformation of VictrolaDesign.com also worked within the back-end limitations of the third-party e-commerce company, so we made sure we closely reviewed the mock-up with a front-end developer. We developed a product catalog, product labels, and packaging for print collateral, featuring the new look and feel.

### Outcome  
Taking the time to define the brand early on really gave the line and marketing collateral a cohesive, unique look. Corbett reports she often receives compliments from clients on the new design. The revamped VictrolaDesign.com also has better functionality, allowing customers to explore product offerings, link to product purchases easily, and filter content by product type and color for a much better search experience. The proof is in the pudding: the online shop helped raise sales by 75% over the first two months after the new site launched—naturally!

Visitors to IBM.com deserve to have an efficient and delightful experience while on their journey.\n\nCarbon for IBM.com is a design system built to provide efficiency and consistency across IBM.com using IBM Design Language (IDL) principles.\n\nThe IBM.com makers need a centralized place to find guidance and resources for designers and developers who create sites and applications on IBM.com and other IBM domains so that IBM can provide a seamless and integrated experience for IBM.com visitors.\n\n  </Column>\n\n  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4} offsetMd={1} offsetLg={1}>\n\n<Aside>\n\n**Role**  \nDesign Lead  \nDesigner  \nContent trubutor  \n\n**Client**  \nIBM  \n\n**Project duration**  \nApril 2020 - present  \n\n</Aside>\n\n  </Column>\n\n</Row>\n\n![A picture of case study one](./../images/work-carbonforibmdotcom-image01.jpg)\n\n### Process  \nThe Carbon for IBM.com website is built with the Carbon Gatsby Theme. Understanding the theme's ability and limitation is the first step before starting on the project after AI and user research are done. For the user research, I collaborate with UX designers to validate the adoptor's hypothesis and set the definition of what a Cupcake website is and should contain. The strategy is to develop a Cupcake website. This website contains the essential information that IBM.com makers need to know to download the design kit, codebase, and adapt the design system.\n\n<Row>\n\n  <Column colMd={6} colLg={6}>\n\n![A picture of case study one](./../images/work-carbonforibmdotcom-image02.jpg)\n\n<Caption fullWidth>Mobile view exploration</Caption>\n\n  </Column>\n\n  <Column colMd={6} colLg={6}>\n\n![A picture of case study one](./../images/work-carbonforibmdotcom-image03.jpg)\n\n<Caption fullWidth>Components thumbnail samples</Caption>\n\n  </Column>\n\n</Row>\n\n### Outcome  \n- A total of 15,525 page-views and 5,476 users since launching in June 2020. \n- A 75% growth in page-views and 93% growth in users since launching in June 2020. \n- It brings a total of 54 pages published by the end of 2020.\n\nThe next step is to get adopter feedback, discover adopter needs from using the Cupcake website, ideate the Birthday Cake website's content structure, and craft a roadmap to grow the website to meet adopter needs continually.\n\n<MiniCard title=\"Visit Carbon for IBM.com website\" href=\"https://www.ibm.com/standards/carbon/\" />\n\n<!-- new section -->\n    \n## Variable Magazine\n\n\n<Row>\n\n  <Column colMd={7} colLg={7}>\n\nFormerly known as All Things X, Variable is an internal culture magazine that focuses on unifying IBM's humans through the stories they tell. As an official IBM Studios offering, we ship thousands of volumes to every IBM Studio worldwide. I co-lead and transform culture and outcomes through attitudes, working styles, and initiatives within the team and business unit in 55 global IBM Studios. The goal is to promote our design-driven culture through purposeful and thought-provoking content.\n\nIBMers need a way to engage and share stores actively within IBM and the larger world of design to have a sense of togetherness and build the IBM design culture.\n\n  </Column>\n\n  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4} offsetMd={1} offsetLg={1}>\n\n<Aside>\n\n**Role**  \nDesign Lead  \nDesigner  \nContent trubutor  \n\n**Client**  \nIBM  \n\n**Project duration**  \nApril 2016 - present  \n\n</Aside>\n\n  </Column>\n\n</Row>\n\n![A picture of case study two](./../images/work-variable-image01.jpg)\n\n### Process  \nEvery issue starts with an ideation phase. Designers who are interested in contributing to the up-coming issue pitch their ideas. We then come together as a team, select a theme for the issue, and start brainstorming story ideas. From there, we sign up for the stories we’re passionate about, and the role we want to play—designer, writer, editor, illustrator, etc. I could be the content writer for one story but a designer for another. As an IBMer, we always utilize Enterprise Design Thinking, to Observe, Reflect, and Make throughout the editorial process.\n\n<Row>\n\n  <Column colMd={6} colLg={6}>\n\n![A picture of case study two](./../images/work-variable-image02.jpg)\n\n<Caption fullWidth>VOL 5 / Spirit</Caption>\n\n  </Column>\n\n  <Column colMd={6} colLg={6}>\n\n![A picture of case study two](./../images/work-variable-image03.jpg)\n\n<Caption fullWidth>VOL 10 / The Dark Side of the Design</Caption>\n\n  </Column>\n\n</Row>\n\n### Outcome  \nAt its core, Variable connects designers across the company, amplifies the culture of design across the organization, and for the clients who get the opportunity to flip through the magazine in one of our studios—it helps represent the new IBM.

We looked at the potential competitors, created sketches and mock-ups, reviewed paper samples, and tested print to finalize the look and printing details. From there, we created a branding guide to serve as a reference. The transformation of VictrolaDesign.com also worked within the back-end limitations of the third-party e-commerce company, so we made sure we closely reviewed the mock-up with a front-end developer. We developed a product catalog, product labels, and packaging for print collateral, featuring the new look and feel.\n\n<Row>\n\n  <Column colMd={6} colLg={6}>\n\n![A picture of case study three](./../images/work-victrola-image02.jpg)\n\n<Caption fullWidth>Tote bag</Caption>\n\n  </Column>\n\n  <Column colMd={6} colLg={6}>\n\n![A picture of case study three](./../images/work-victrola-image03.jpg)\n\n<Caption fullWidth>Pin button</Caption>\n\n  </Column>\n\n</Row>\n\n### Outcome  \nTaking the time to define the brand early on really gave the line and marketing collateral a cohesive, unique look. Corbett reports she often receives compliments from clients on the new design. The revamped VictrolaDesign.com also has better functionality, allowing customers to explore product offerings, link to product purchases easily, and filter content by product type and color for a much better search experience.
